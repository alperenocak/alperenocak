## "We look at the same stars and see very different things." - Jon Snow 📚👑

I'm a student at 42 Kocaeli, diving deep into the coding world while remembering that "Winter is Coming".

### 🛡️ My Skills

- **C++** 🏰 - The complex architecture of Highgarden
- **C#** 🗡️ - A sharp dagger made of Valyrian steel
- **MSSQL** 📜 - Data storage skills like the vast library of the Citadel

### 🐲 My Projects
- 🔥 [`printf`](https://github.com/alperenocak/printf) — Forged the basics in fire and ice  
- 📜 [`get_next_line`](https://github.com/alperenocak/get_next_line) — Scanned ancient texts, one line at a time  
- ⚔️ [`push_swap`](https://github.com/alperenocak/push_swap) — Algorithmic duels, fast and fierce

### 🔮 My Learning Journey
At 42 Kocaeli, like Jon Snow's rise among the Night's Watch, I'm progressing step by step in the world of software development. Inspired by the phrase "You know nothing, Jon Snow," I strive to learn something new every day.
